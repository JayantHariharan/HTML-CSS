        <h2>One Piece</h2>
        <br>
        <img src="/Images/606263.jpg" width="900">
        <h3>One Piece has become something of a colossal cult-phenomenon around the world, though it's a household name in Japan thanks to Toei Animation's seemingly undying commitment to Shonen Jump adaptations, such as Dragon Ball, Dr. Slump, Saint Seiya and Slam Dunk.
            At over 900 episodes this show has become probably the longest running digitally-painted anime in history: thanks to Toei's transition to digital cel-animation in the late 1990s. This show's got great characters, a fun world and the action gets just enough punch to not be too boring or derivative of Toei's other Shonen-derived shows.
            This is an anime household name and anyone into Japanese animation should give this one a shot. P.S. You DON'T need to have seen all of this show's episodes because... y'know: it's ridiculous catch-up time in one sitting.</h3>

        <h2>Naruto</h2>
        <br>
        <img src="/Images/605592.png" width="900">
        <h3>I'm sure by now that you're read plenty of reviews that have exclaimed on its pros and cons, so I will only go into them very lightly.Cons first. The animation isn't bad, but could be better. Meh...I'm fine with the animation, yet others seem to make a big deal over it. Whatever. Also, it has been mentioned often that Naruto is very like DBZ. That it is. Its main similarity/flaw is how long the fights take. Although its not as bad as DBZ, some fights take up to 3 or 4 episodes which is a bit drawn out. >.< Other than the intros and outros (which are wonderful!) the music is pretty bland. Meh. So those are all of the bad things I could think of. Seriously though, I like the series enough that I don't mind or even notice any of these 'flaws'. People just seem to like to complain about them.
            Yay! Pro time! Again, lets touch on Naruto's similarities to DBZ. Naruto is head and shoulders above DBZ on almost every level. Naruto actually has GASP character depth and development! This is one of Naruto's strong points. The reason the series is so addictive is how likable all of the characters are. So even if you don't like the main characters (Naruto-loud, clumsy, strong willed. Sasuke-cold, angsty, strong. Sakura-love struck and smart) there are PLENTY of minor characters to satisfy any of your favorite character cravings. All of my favorite characters are side characters! Also, the villains have depth unlike DBZ. All of the villains actually have a reason (no matter how psychotic) to do what they do. Tragedy seems to be a big part of Naruto and almost every character has suffered including the villains.
            OK, I'm done. I say Definitely check this series out, you'll become hooked, I promise! Keep a lookout for my favorite characters: Neji, Itachi and Gaara!! 9/10</h3>

       <h2>Attack on Titan</h2>
        <br>
        <img src="/Images/653529.jpg" width="900">
        <h3>
            It continunes few days after where we left off last season and it focuses more on political drama and dilemmas inside the walls. This season gets straight to the point and introduces new villain named Kenny that turns out to be somehow related to Levi. There are many parties trying to get Eren and Historia. For what reason? It is yet to be reveald. Mystery we all feel in love with is still there and there are even more questions, but don't let that distract you from the fact that this season ,even tho is only few episodes in, already has some major reveals in it. Pacing is amazing and i wasn't bored for a moment while watching. Things are only getting more interesting when Erwin reveals how he's planning to ovethrow the governmant without using the force. This season has a very refreshing and different plot compared to previous ones as we can see from the lack of titans and focuse on the issues inside the walls rather than beyond. However it's still as, if not more interesting than before. There is world buidling,mystery,back stabbing and some major questions answered which there is hopfully more to come.</h3>

       <h2>Death Note</h2>
        <br>
        <img src="/Images/667209.jpg" width="900">
        <h3>This is anime at its best. I'm fairly new to the world of anime, but I have to say from what I've seen that Death Note goes above and beyond your typical run-of-the-mill action based anime. Whereas a lot of anime strategically relies on action packed battles and fights, Death Note is a refreshing change of pace. It's slick, clever, and witty with the eccentric "L" heading the investigation. It's a constant game of cat and mouse as the lead investigator and the suspected "Kira" or "Killer" always seem to be one step ahead of one another. The two brilliant minds constantly outwit each other. The plot is complex but easily laid out for you and the story is remarkably intelligent and inventive. All the while you're watching you think, "Wow, this can't possibly get any deeper," but each new episode proves you wrong. What I like the most is that this is very, very complex material but it's flawlessly and easily presented so each new development in the case comes as an excited shock.This is great stuff and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who might be looking for a change of pace in anime. It's not for everyone, of course since it's more of an intellectual thriller and not so much an action fantasy, but anyone who can appreciate the mental challenge of following along with this suspenseful battle of wits will be in heaven with Death Note.</h3>

        <h2>Demon Slayer</h2>
        <br>
        <img src="/Images/1198624.png" width="900">
        <h3>I'm an attack on titan fan and even I have to admit that it's a really good show...the animation from ufotable is just absolutely brilliant and beats most anime and all animated shows around the planet. I admit, the storyline of demon slayer isn't anything new, some people say it's an overrated show, some say it's cliche...and that's ok...why???...because every single person is entitled to their own opinion...the criticisms might be true but I will say this...there's a reason why this anime is so popular and there's a reason why so many people not only in Japan but around the world enjoy it. Not every single anime or TV show has to have a plot twist of a story like attack on titan or Vinland saga, as long as its entertaining and enjoyable for everyone to enjoy then really thats all that matters. Demon slayer is a good show and I would highly recommend it to anyone especially people who aren't anime watchers, it's incredible.</h3>

        <h2>Tokyo Revengers</h2>
        <br>
        <img src="/Images/1302159.jpg" width="900">
        <h3>The story in manga is almost at the peak and it is very impressive seeing the anime is just the manga in motion and it is going great so far, the humor and many serious aspects are well placed , you might find it similar to erased where the protagonist goes back in time to save his mother and faces multiple timelines where he fails and in the end he succeeds , the story doesn't unnecessarily adds side character's backstory ,it's for the better connection between the characters each and every character fit in and contribute and support the story equally the concept of the major storyline is very fresh the manga doesn't bore at any point of time the plots and the factors which usually don't contribute to the main story never fails to entertain and keep the expectations of the reader or the viewer of the anime even the chemistry between the protagonist and the secondary characters is quite different , the character development of all the characters is very intriguing as each character is developed differently and is given more time , every story has a antagonist who is a mirror of the main character a someone who observes the world differently tokyo revengers keeps you guessing who the villain is, overall the manga is amazing the anime might get around 40+ episodes I am looking forward to keep up this anime is a must watch truly this anime is will stay in heart forever peace.</h3>
